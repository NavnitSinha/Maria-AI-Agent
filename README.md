# 🧠 Maria-AI-Agent

Voice AI agent built with GPT-4o + VAPI.ai for Nurix AI’s Prompt Engineering Challenge. Maria handles identity verification, overdue payments, and objections with empathetic, real-time conversations powered by advanced prompt design.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Create a conversational AI agent named **Maria** who:
- Verifies user identity (via SSN or DOB)
- Communicates overdue amount ($710, due April 1, 2025)
- Offers flexible payment plans with interest
- Handles objections, interruptions, and user emotions naturally
- Speaks with clarity, empathy, and human-like tone

## 💡 Prompt Engineering Strategy

> A carefully structured system prompt was created to guide Maria’s behavior. It includes:
- One-question-at-a-time flow
- Natural, empathetic tone with clarity
- Strict identity verification before disclosure
- Tiered fallback logic (SSN ➝ DOB)
- Graceful handling of objections, disputes, or payment inability

Special attention was paid to edge cases, tone consistency, and adaptive flow control.
